None of us had gotten very much sleep the night before, so we rotated between sleeping and talking to each other so whoever was driving could stay awake. On our way eastwards from I-5, we saw the sun rising over the hills in the distance."

Something interesting that stood out during this part of our journey was that many of the reservoirs that we passed were either dry or at much lower water levels than anticipated; it really highlighted the fact that California is facing a severe drought in 2014."
